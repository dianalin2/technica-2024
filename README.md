## Problem
A big problem within graphic design is accessibility. However, we think the solution lies beyond the graphics.  Through alternative text, people who have limited vision can understand the information conveyed in the graphic; however, designers may find it time consuming to add helpful alternative text, creating a hurdle when it comes to visual accessibility. 

## Inspiration
We're all creative, artsy individuals, so we wanted to work with Adobe Express to create and showcase our hack. It was a no-brainer to create an Adobe Express add-on. We chose to use the OpenAI library for the artificial intelligence because of its free nature and ease of integration.

## What it does
Aira is integrated directly with Adobe Express, so with the click of a button, our software uses artificial intelligence technology to scan your project and generate accessible alternative text for it. This can be easily copied and pasted into wherever you export your projects.

## How we built it
We built Aira using the Adobe Add-On SDK, React, NodeJS, and the OpenAI API.

## Challenges we ran into
Three of our members had little to no experience in the tech stack, and none of us had experience with AI integration. so a lot of the time at the hackathon was spent learning. However, we were able to push through and create good products!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to not only create the Adobe Express add-on but also a website that explains our add-on and how to use it.

## What we learned
We all learned a lot about React and the OpenAI frameworks. We also learned how to work together as a team, since this was our first time hacking together. Self-care and a mindset aimed towards growth were key during this weekend.

## What's next for Aira
In the future, we hope to add integration for other softwares such as Canva, and update the website so that alt text can be created on-site.
